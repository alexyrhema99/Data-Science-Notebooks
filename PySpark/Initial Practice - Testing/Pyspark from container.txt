# initially launch docker container 
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 jupyter/pyspark-notebook

# after exiting, get the docker CONTAINER ID
docker ps -a

# if needed, stop the container
docker stop <CONTAINER ID>

# Start the docker container for your previous session
docker start <CONTAINER ID>

#Your Jupyter notebook server will then again be running on 
http://localhost:8888

# Get the Jupyter token by entering the container
docker exec -it <CONTAINER ID> /bin/bash
# and running
jupyter notebook list
# when logging in, you can set the password so that this step is no longer necessary
